## Key Findings
    High-level Metrics
- Total Units Sold: Over 16 million units, a strong volume indicator.
- Regions Covered: 5 regions, showing broad market coverage in 48 states of the US, suggesting a decent retail network.
- Total Revenue: $8.2 million, which, when compared with units sold, gives an average price/unit of $0.48.
- Retailer Count: 4 major retailers, indicating sales are concentrated among a few key partners.

- Monthly Revenue: There is a clear upward trend in revenue by month, peaking in the last month shown (over $2.5M), which may indicate seasonality, promotions, or market growth.

- Beverage Brand Performance: Coca-Cola leads in total revenue among brands, followed by Dasani Water and Diet Coke. Sprite is the lowest among those listed, suggesting potential for growth or under-performance which needs to be checked urgently.

Regional Analysis
The dashboard allows filtering by region and beverage brand, which is useful for identifying regional strengths and brand-specific trends.    
    
    
    
The West region is the best performing region with 2.4M revenue generated and the Midwest region with 1.15M. There should be a sales promotion or a retailer swap in the Midwest region to promote sales.
